Here's a rewritten version of the `serverr/README.md` file with some improvements:

Chisel Web UI
================

A web-based interface for [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Chisel Web UI, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tecworks-dev/chisel-webui.git
```

### 2. Change into the repository directory

```bash
cd chisel-webui
```

### 3. Make the installation script executable

```bash
chmod +x install_server.sh
```

### 4. Run the installation script

```bash
./install_server.sh
```

### Default Server Configuration
By default, the Chisel Web UI server will start on port 8000. You can access the web interface by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

I added a new section to highlight the default server configuration, including the port number. Let me know if you have any further requests!







This will install the necessary dependencies and configure the Chisel Web UI.

I made the following changes:

* Added a title and a brief description of the project
* Reformatted the text to make it more readable
* Added section headers to break up the content
* Used Markdown formatting to make the text more visually appealing
* Removed unnecessary whitespace and blank lines

Let me know if you have any further requests!
